# Review - Modern Software Engineering

Henrik Samuelsson, 2022 January 01

## Abstract

A well worth read for anyone in the software industry that have managed to grasp the basics of software development and now want to take it to the next level. But should also serve as a gentle reminder to highly experienced people on what really works to avoid being stressed out by massive technical debt, missed dead-lines, and long bug lists.

## Description

David Farley have a background as a software engineer and have made contributions in the field of continuous integration. He shares his expertize through various media such as Youtube, books, and by providing training courses.

The book aims to helps software professionals think about their work more effectively, manage it more successfully, and improve the quality of the code being developed.

The book is split into three main parts where the first is about learning. By learning is here meant how to be able to improve software development by learning what works and what does not. Having (fast) feedback loops. Experiment a lot but in a controlled way to be able deduce what helped. Do not assume anything without testing your assumptions. Benefits of working incrementally.

Second part is about how to reduce complexity. Working with modularity to be able to make changes and combine modules in new ways in future projects. Cohesion, try to keep things together that change for the same reason. Separation of concerns, the code, the by now classic example that a function should do one thing and do it well comes into play here. Information hiding and abstraction to be able to hide away all the gory details and see the big picture when needed. Strategies for minimizing the cost of coupling.

Third part is shorter and is a high level discussion on tools. Mainly how pointers on how to acheive testability.

The main material is mixed up with short real world stories that complements and the more theoretical main discussions.

## Analysis

Farley comes across to me as he know what he is talking about both from a practical viewpoint and a more theoretical side. He have been working with software development himself for many years but he also makes multiple references to valid books and research showing that he has also done his homework by taking time to learn.

The material presented is in the book is maybe nothing ground breaking but it is presented in a good and clear way albeit sometimes at a very high level. There is however some deep dives into actual code snippets. The "war stories" that breaks of the ordinary material regularly throughout the book complements the text very well and were both interesting as well as helping out to clarify the material.

All the software companies that I have worked at could greatly improve the quality and efficiency if managing to get everyone to understand and start following the concepts presented in the book. The same goes for me personally I can rarly be disciplined enough to work in the more structured way presented in the book even if it would help me greatly in the long run.

A downside about the book is that you can feel a bit like you are left hanging and wonder what to do next now. This is because the book is often written at a high level and lacks details. On the other hand so will this book in the way it is written be able to be relevant for a long time and might even in the future become one of the classic software development books.
